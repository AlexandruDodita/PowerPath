# PowerPath

## Vision
PowerPath is a sleek, in-browser fitness tracker designed to simplify your workout experience. With seamless user authentication and a clean, intuitive interface, PowerPath allows users to log in, start new workouts, or review past sessions to track progress effortlessly.

## Technology
PowerPath was built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, evolving alongside the developerâ€™s learning journey. The project leverages native JavaScript for the frontend, with Node.js and Express powering the backend. This combination ensures a lightweight yet functional architecture, ideal for local deployment, while keeping it scalable for the future.

## Future Development
Currently, PowerPath is in its early stages and operates locally, requiring some user-side configuration. The next phase of development focuses on hosting the platform and integrating a robust database. Future enhancements include progress-tracking graphs for key lifts and muscle groups, daily weigh-in logs, and an integrated fitness blog. More features are planned to expand functionality and improve user experience.

### Note: Github pages does not allow for a proper back-end. Thus, there is limited functionality available on Github pages.
